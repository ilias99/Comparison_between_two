      "B. Area of Applicability\n",
      "(1) These allowable damage limits for dents are applicable to the center fuselage in the area from FR35 thru FR47, STGR26LH thru STGR26RH (above belly fairing).\n",
      "(2) These allowable damage limits are applicable to skin panels in aluminum skins.\n",
      "(3) For dent type 1 excluded areas, refer to Figure 001.\n",
      "(4) For applicability of dent dress-out, refer to applicability of Dent Type 1.\n",
      "C. Weight Variant Applicability\n",
      "D. Limits/Restrictions\n",
      "(1) Dent Type 2 is not permitted.\n",
      "(2) For allowable damage threshold limits, refer to \n",
      "Diagram 001.\n",
      "(3) These allowable damage limits are not applicable for dents caused by hail damage. If dents are caused by hail damage, do a skin repair as given in relevant repair task or contact AIRBUS.\n",
      "(4) Make sure that the dents around static ports, pitot probe, multifunction probes and side-slip angle probes are within aerodynamic requirements, refer to TASK 53-00-11283-003.\n",
      "(5) If the dent affects multiple skin thicknesses, each skin thickness must be considered and the most restrictive limitation must be applied.\n",
      "(6) Check if allowable dent is permitted. If not, do a skin repair as per relevant repair task or contact AIRBUS before next flight.\n",
      "E. Repair Category This allowable damage task is category B or C. For details, refer to \n",
      "Diagram 001. For the detailed definition of repair categories, refer to Chapter 51-11-14.\n",
