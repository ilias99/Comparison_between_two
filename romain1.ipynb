      "2- Compare the dent dimensions with the allowable damage limits and obey the relevant instructions, refer to Diagram 002.\n",

Make sure that dent dimensions are within the limit for dent dress-out, refer to Diagram 001. Make sure that the dent is in an applicable (not excluded) area, refer to Figure 001. Make sure that the dent is free of crack and do an external and internal HFEC inspection before and after dress-out, (Refer to NTM TASK 51-10-08-250-802). Dress-out by a hot process changing material characteristics is not permitted.\n",

      "1- Make sure that the dent is free from sharp edges.\n",
      "2- For areas where distance between stringers is more than or equal to 360 mm (14.17 in): Make sure that the maximum dimension of the dent in a circumferential direction is less than 330 mm (12.99 in). If not, do a skin repair or contact AIRBUS before next flight.\n",

      "(d) Damage evaluation of dents type 2.\n",
      "1- Make sure that the dent is in applicable area. Dents are not applicable: at skin panel doubler location. at panel junction. at cutout surrounding. at window frame joint area. at crack stopper location. over integrated stiffeners. at level of machined parts. at level of extruded parts.\n",

      "1- To dress-out the dent, fulfill following conditions, refer to Chapter 51-73-00. If one of the following conditions is not fulfilled, do not dress-out the dent: Make sure that the skin is aluminum alloy \"2000 series\". Make sure that dent dimensions are within the limit for dent dress-out, refer to Diagram 001. Make sure that the dent is in an applicable (not excluded) area, refer to Figure 001. Make sure that the dent is free of crack and do an external and internal HFEC inspection before and after dress-out, (Refer to NTM TASK 51-10-08-250-802). Dress-out by a hot process changing material characteristics is not permitted.\n",
